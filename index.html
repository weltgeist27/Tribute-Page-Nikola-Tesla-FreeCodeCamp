				<p style="text-indent: 10px">Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his copious inventions into long-term financial success—unlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.</p>
				<h4>Here's a timeline of Nikola Tesla's life:</h4>
			
				<ul>
					<li><strong>1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</li>
					<li><strong>1875</strong> - Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.</li>
					<li><strong>1882</strong> - Went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>
					<li><strong>1882</strong> - Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</li>
					<li><strong>1884</strong> - Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</li>
					<li><strong>1885</strong> - After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</li>
					<li><strong>1886</strong> - Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li>
					<li><strong>1887</strong> - The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.</li>
					<li><strong>1891</strong> - In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>
					<li><strong>1891</strong> - With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>
					<li><strong>1901</strong> - In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li>
					<li><strong>1915</strong> - On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</li>
					<li><strong>1934</strong> - In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>
					<li><strong>1943</strong> - On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.</li>
					<li><strong>1960</strong> - The scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.</li>
